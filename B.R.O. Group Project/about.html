                  <h3> History Of The Orchestra</h3>
                  <p>In 2006 the orchestra became a truly North Queensland orchestra when in March a number of string players from Cairns travelled to Townsville to rehearse under Professor Hopkins for the planned Tchaikovsky concert. Unfortunately, the interruption of Cyclone Larry prevented the repeat performance scheduled for Cairns.</p>

                  <h4>2008</h4>
                  <p>In 2008 this last concert generated an award from the Townsville City Council as "Best Musical Event 2007" and after a mammoth launch at the Townsville City CouncilChambers the year began with a concert under the baton of visiting UK conductor Mark Eager. This was a collaboration with a combined High Schools orchestra and demonstrated the depth of musical talent flowing up from the district's excellent Instrumental Music programs. The concert culminated in BRO combining with the high school orchestra for a stirring 1812 Overture!</p>

                  <p>Then followed a terrific concert featuring Matthew Rigby, the 2007 winner of the North Queensland Concerto and Vocal Competition, conducted by John Hopkins OBE, continuing a fruitful collboration promoting young rising musicians.</p>

                  <h4>2009</h4>
                  <p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra proudly announced that Her Excellency, the Governor of Queensland Penelope Wensley agreed to be patron of our orchestra.</p>

                  <p>2009 was a year of highs and lows for the Barrier Reef Orchestra...<br />Our first concert in March was conducted by Richard McIntyre but we had pre-concert drama as our soloist had to retire due to injury.  We fortunately were able to get Marcus Stocker at the last minute to play the Dvorak concerto. The program of Dvorak and Sibelius challenged the orchestra but the challenge and drama became greater due to the failure of the airconditioning at Riverway.</p>

                  <p>With the venue getting hotter and hotter during rehearsal we had to decide whether to go ahead or cancel the event. We decided to go ahead and most of our loyal audience stayed with us but it was hard going. Rick who is from cold Canberra certainly got a feel of the tropics that night as did everyone that attended.</p>

                  <h4>2010</h4>
                  <p>As promised, Ji Won Kim duly performed in our March Concert Romantic Interludes at the Riverway Arts Centre. This well attended concert featured Beethoven Violin Concerto with Ji Won giving a stunning performance. The concert also included Schubert’s Rosamunde Overture and the “unfinished” Symphony No. 8 by Schubert. Conductor was Professor John Hopkins. </p>

                  <h4>2011</h4>
                  <p>We have had a notable and rewarding year which saw the Orchestra include other arts groups to great advantage – three choirs, 1RAR Band and Townsville Cinema Group were all involved with us this year. The three concerts attracted a total of 1,457 patrons and two were full houses.</p>

                  <p>Sponsorship support in 2011 was excellent and combined with good box office numbers has enabled us to further build up our cash reserves which two years ago were dangerously low.</p>

                  <h4>2012</h4>
                  <p>2012 was a very successful year for the orchestra. We presented three concerts, one at Riverway Arts Centre and two at the Civic Theatre. Each was well received and well patronized – a total of 1,434 patrons between the three concerts. Not only is our audience increasing but so also is the orchestra itself – we have many new players and numbered 65 or more musicians on stage at each concert. Our general membership is also increasing and perhaps reflecting this trend (and the increasing workload) we now have an enthusiastic management committee that is twelve strong.</p>

                  <p>The 2012 concert season was very varied. The March concert was conducted by our artistic director Richard McIntyre and was Russian themed – Prokopiev, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky. It featured Edwina George – the 2011 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner as violin soloist and we also had Sebastien Lipman from Brisbane on harp.</p>

                  <h4>2013</h4>
                  <p>In 2013 we staged three  successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons.  In March the  “Works of Art” concert was a sellout at Riverway.  Mussorgsky, Strauss  and Haydn with conductor Mario Dobernig was well  received by an appreciative audience.</p>

                  <p>2013 saw us maintain our  membership numbers and our financial position remained strong.  We cover  approximately 60% of our expenditure from box office income (which is  considered to be very good by not-for-profit arts  organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants,  sponsorship and philanthropy.</p>

                  <p>A new fund raising approach in  2013 was our Benefactors appeal.  This has had a good start with 17  benefactors currently enrolled and the first renewals about to  commence.   I believe this particular avenue of fund raising  will strengthen over time and prove to be a very reliable source of  income provided it is proactively managed.</p>

                  <p>2013 saw our first encouragement  awards.   Two young orchestra members – Craig Land and Lexie Gorton –  each received a well deserved $500 award in recognition of their  enthusiastic participation in the orchestra and their  musical development.</p>
